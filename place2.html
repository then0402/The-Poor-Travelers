			<p>The Great Cave is approximately 3.1 km from the park headquarters and is easily reached via the plank walk which is surrounded by dense primary rainforest. The stroll along plank walk is fascinating as you pass by benuang trees (Octomeles sumatrana) with their enormous buttressed roots, padanus plants twice the size of a person, exquisitely formed orchids and tree fungi.</p>
			
			<p>Walking quietly along the way, you may see some of the park’s wildlife such as colourful birds, squirrels, lizards, butterflies, unusual insects and invertebrates. If you are lucky, you may see flying lizards.</p>

				<figcaption>Painted Cave </figcaption>
			</div>
			
			<p>This is the site of the famous Niah cave paintings and the place where the ‘death-ships’ were found. The contents of the death-ships have since been transferred to the Sarawak Museum, but the cave paintings and some of the empty death-ships can still be viewed on the wall behind the fenced-off burial site.</p>
			
			<p>The paintings can be difficult to see unless you allow your eyes to become accustomed to the light. They are rendered in red hematite and cover a long narrow strip (approximately 30m) at the back of the cave wall. They portray spread-eagled human figures, probably representing warriors and hunters, some of the animals of the surrounding forest, and most importantly, longboats carrying the souls of the deceased on the dangerous journey to the land of the dead.</p>
